# ECG heart diseases prediction

This is a scientific work related to the analysis of ECG data and the prediction of heart diseases using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
TODO

Input dataset: gender, age, class1, class2, class3, t1 - t60000 (values of ECG lead graphs, t1-t5000 - first ECG lead, t5001-t10000 - second ECG lead and so on), class1, class2, class3 - the presence of heart disease (three columns, since a combination of diseases is possible).
The dataset contains 12 leads with 5000 values for each.
At the moment, classification is carried out only by class1 (10 classes), i.e. the underlying diagnosis is predicted.
